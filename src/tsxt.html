    <h2>Family Immigration in the United States: A Comprehensive Guide</h2>
    <h2>Understanding Family-Based Immigration</h2>
    <p>Family-based immigration is one of the primary pathways to permanent residency in the United States. This system
        allows U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to sponsor certain family members for immigration benefits,
        enabling them to live and work permanently in the United States. The process reflects the nation's commitment to
        family unity and represents a significant portion of legal immigration to the United States each year.</p>
    <h2>Categories of Family-Based Immigration</h2>
    <h3>Immediate Relatives of U.S. Citizens</h3>
    <p>Immediate relatives have special immigration priority and are not subject to annual numerical limitations. This
        category includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spouses of U.S. citizens</li>
        <li>Unmarried children under 21 years of age</li>
        <li>Parents of U.S. citizens (if the U.S. citizen is 21 or older)</li>
        <li>Adopted children who meet specific requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Family Preference Categories</h3>
    <p>These categories are subject to annual numerical limits and often involve waiting periods:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>First Preference (F1)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Unmarried adult sons and daughters (21 or older) of U.S. citizens</li>
                <li>Includes their minor children</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Second Preference (F2)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>F2A: Spouses and unmarried children (under 21) of permanent residents</li>
                <li>F2B: Unmarried adult sons and daughters of permanent residents</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens</li>
                <li>Includes their spouses and minor children</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fourth Preference (F4)</strong>
            <ul>

                <li>Includes their spouses and minor children</li>

    </ol>
    <h2>The Immigration Process</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Filing the Petition</h3>
    <p>The process begins with filing Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative). This petition establishes the family
        relationship between the sponsor and the intending immigrant. Required documentation typically includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Proof of the sponsor's U.S. citizenship or permanent residency</li>
        <li>Evidence of the family relationship</li>
        <li>Birth certificates, marriage certificates, or adoption papers</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Step 2: Priority Date and Visa Availability</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For immediate relatives: Visa numbers are always available</li>

                <li>The country of origin</li>
                <li>The priority date (date when I-130 was properly filed)</li>
            </ul>
